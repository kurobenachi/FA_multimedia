      <h1>The Significance of Kanbun Education in Japan:<br>
      A Comparative Analysis of Classical Education</h1>

      <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Classical education plays an important role in shaping a nation's cultural identity 
  and political cohesion. While many countries have elective courses in foreign classical 
  languages such as Latin, and ancient Greek, not many countries have mandatory courses.
  Classical education, particularly in <a href="#kanbun-image">the form of Kanbun in Japan</a>, 
  not only preserves linguistic heritage but also reinforces national identity, 
  which is a critical aspect of political stability and societal integration. 
  The teaching of Kanbun, rooted in Japan’s historical and cultural exchanges with China, 
  highlights how education systems can serve as tools for political socialization, 
  instilling shared values and cultural continuity among citizens.

<p>
  Although classical Chinese, called Kanbun, has long been an integral part of education 
  in Japan as compulsory, its importance has sometimes been criticized. However, from a 
  political perspective, <a href="#kundoku-image">Kanbun education</a> can be seen as a means 
  of fostering a collective cultural identity and a sense of belonging, which are essential 
  for a cohesive and stable society. Various papers have mentioned the uniqueness of Kanbun 
  teaching methods, such as the Kundoku system of reconstructing Classical Chinese into 
  Japanese, which not only demonstrates linguistic innovation but also reflects the political 
  and cultural adaptations that have shaped Japanese society over centuries.

<p>
  This paper aims to emphasize the necessity of Kanbun education in Japan by drawing 
  comparisons with classical language education in other countries. By examining the 
  political implications of classical education in shaping national identity and promoting 
  cultural continuity, the discussion will provide insights into why Kanbun remains relevant 
  today. The first section introduces the current educational situation in Japan. The 
  following sections will illustrate the situation of some European and East Asian countries 
  and their backgrounds, a comparison of each country, and a discussion of the importance 
  of Kanbun education.
</p>

      

      <h2 id="classical-japan">2. Classical foreign language education in Japan</h2>
      <p>
        The reception of Classical Chinese in Japan has a rich history dating back more than
        a millennium. Ab initio, Kanji was gradually adopted into Japanese culture from the
        third to the seventh century along with the visit of <a href="#toraijin-comparison">‘Toraijin’</a>; henceforth influenced
        by Chinese culture, Japan adopted Classical Chinese as its scholarly language and
        used it for Japanese literature (<a href="References/Takeo_2007.pdf" target="_blank">Takeo & Maruyama, 2007</a>). In the middle of the
        Heian period, ‘Kanbun Kundoku’, the system of transforming classical Chinese into
        Japanese, developed and caused the influx of Chinese vocabulary, which had a
        considerable influence on the Japanese language through quotations from classical
        Chinese literature (<a href="References/Sato_2003.pdf" target="_blank">Sato, 2003</a>). After that, classical Chinese, called ‘Kanbun’,
        has continuously played an important role in Japanese literature.

        <figcaption>Figure 3: Comparison of migrant ”Toraijin” and Jomon peoples</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        At present, Kanbun remains an integral part of the Japanese educational system. It is
        typically taught at the secondary level and focuses on the appreciation of Japanese
        culture using ‘Kanbun Kundoku’. Students study a wide range of topics, including
        ancient literature, <a href="#kanbun-poetry-section">poetry</a>, and historical documents, some of which are the source of
        Japanese historical idioms and vocabulary.

        According to <a href="References/MEXT_2017.pdf" target="_blank">the Curriculum Guidelines (2017)</a>, the purpose of classical education in
        Japan is multifaceted. It serves to develop the ability to think and imagine through
        the classics of predecessors, and to deepen the understanding of the nation’s
        traditional language and culture. It also serves to deepen students’ awareness of
        themselves as bearers of Japanese language and culture, and to cultivate an attitude
        of relating to others and society through language.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, classical Chinese education in Japan has long been criticized. Criticism of
        Kanbun education dates back to the Meiji period and is represented by <a href="#images-link000">Hisoka Maejima</a>,
        known as the ‘Father of the Postal System’. He pointed out that Kanbun and Kanji had
        academic difficulties in spreading national education (<a href="References/Masuda_2013.pdf" target="_blank">Masuda, 2013</a>). Considering that
        the beginning of Kanbun as a compulsory education also began in the Meiji period, the
        history of Kanbun education cannot be told without criticism. Nowadays, some argue
        that classical education deprives students of time to study subjects that have a more
        practical use, such as English and economics in the globalized world. While this 
        opinion has received a certain amount of support on the Internet, there are still 
        significant dissenting voices.

      <h2 id="classical-abroad">3. Classical foreign language education Abroad</h2>
      <p>
        This section refers to the teaching of Chinese literature in South Korea and Latin in
        Europe. The reason for this choice is that the historical backgrounds of both regions
        are similar in that <a href="#images-link01">ancient superpowers have greatly influenced</a> the cultures of their
        regions. In addition, there are no examples of classical foreign languages being
        actively taught in secondary education other than Chinese literature, Latin, and
        classical Greek, and classical Greek and Latin are taught in the same European
        region, and Latin has a more dominant position in education because of Christianity.

        In South Korea, classical Chinese is taught as a compulsory subject in secondary
        education, and the method of <a href="#gugyeol">‘Gugyeol’</a>, which is similar to Japanese ‘Kanbun Kundoku’,
        is used to read classical Chinese as Korean. However, it is treated as a foreign
        language subject, in contrast to the Japanese situation, where classical Chinese is
        regarded as a part of its linguistic culture (<a href="References/Kim_2013.pdf" target="_blank">Kim, 2013</a>).
      </p>
      
      <figure id="gugyeol">
        <img src="Images/gugyeoul.png" alt="Figure 9: Gugyeoul, Korean way to reconstruct Classical Chinese" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <figcaption>Figure 9: Gugyeoul, Korean way to reconstruct Classical Chinese</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>
        Korea has long been a tributary state of the Chinese empire and, like Japan, has
        embraced Chinese culture, represented by Buddhism and Confucianism. The degree of
        acceptance is much higher than in Japan because of the Korean characteristics of
        geographical distance from China and tribute. As an indication of this, the creation
        of Chinese literature called Hanmun has been active in Korea, and as many works
        written by Koreans have been adopted as teaching materials for Chinese literature
        as those written in China (<a href="References/Kim_2013.pdf" target="_blank">Kim, 2013</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with the end of the subservient relationship with China at the end of the
        19th century and the emergence of opposition to China, Hangeul, which had been
        invented in the 15th century and was considered inferior to Chinese characters,
        began to replace Chinese characters, and strengthen its position. However, the
        Japanese rule in Korea led to the use of both Chinese characters and Hangeul in Korea
        due to the influence of the Japanese writing system. On the other hand, as a reaction
        to Chinese culture and Japanese rule, Korea eventually promoted the independent use
        of Hangeul (<a href="References/Kim_2013.pdf" target="_blank">Kim, 2013</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        This historical background has had a significant impact on the education of Hanmun in
        Korea today. Although the Hangul-only theory is completely dominant in Korea,
        conservatives, strongly influenced by Confucianism, promote the idea of the combined
        use of Chinese characters and Hangul. Today, Koreans recognise Hanmun as a foreign
        language, but with the intention of recognising Hanmun as part of the national
        language culture, conservatives have chosen Hanmun texts written by Koreans as their
        teaching materials (<a href="References/Kim_2013.pdf" target="_blank">Kim, 2013</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Through <a href="#GIS">the overview of the current situation of Latin education in Europe</a>, a great
        difference between East Asia and Europe in the education of the classical literature
        of the ancient superpowers is revealed. In Italy, 76% of secondary school students
        study Latin, followed by 34% in Austria, 32% in Germany, 24% in Flemish Belgium, 13%
        in France, and only 2.5% in Poland (<a href="References/Malinowski_2016.pdf" target="_blank">Malinowski, 2016</a>). In Croatia, since the learning
        of foreign languages is considered very important, two years of compulsory Latin are
        generally required in secondary education (<a href="References/Prpic_2009.pdf" target="_blank">Prpić, 2009</a>).
      </p>

        <figcaption>Figure 10: GIS of the rate of Latin learner in Europe</figcaption>

      <p>
        According to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Latin-language" target="_blank">Posner and Sala (2023)</a>, Latin instruction in Europe has a rich and
        extensive history that spans many centuries. Its origins can be traced back to
        ancient Rome, where Latin was the language of the Roman Empire. During this time,
        Latin served as the lingua franca of Europe, uniting diverse regions under a common
        language.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Roman Empire began to decline, Latin continued to be used by the Catholic
        Church as the language of <a href="#vulgata">religious texts and liturgy</a>. The medieval period saw Latin
        being taught in monastic schools and cathedral schools, where it was considered
        essential for clergy and scholars. However, in the Renaissance, Latin's everyday use
        declined with the rise of vernacular languages.
      </p>

      <figure id="vulgata">
        <img src="Images/Vulgata.jpg" alt="Figure 11: 16th century manuscript of the Vulgate (Latin translation of the Bible)" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <figcaption>Figure 11: 16th century manuscript of the Vulgate (Latin translation of the Bible)</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Thenceforth, with the rise of vernacular languages and the spread of nationalism,
        Latin's dominance started to wane. The later period witnessed a gradual decline in
        the teaching of Latin in schools, as modern languages and sciences gained prominence.
        Today, Latin instruction is primarily limited to specialized schools and
        universities. While no longer a widespread subject, Latin continues to have a
        significant influence on scientific, legal, and theological terminology.
      </p>

      <h2 id="comparison">4. Comparison and Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        By comparing these different approaches, the uniqueness of Japanese classical Chinese
        education can be seen. This uniqueness comes from treating it as a part of Japanese
        language culture. By reading Kanbun using the Kundoku method, students can better
        understand the cultural history of both Japanese and Chinese, including cultural
        exchanges in East Asian history. It is an integrated approach that combines language
        skills, literary appreciation, and cultural understanding in one package.
      </p>
      <p>
        Promoting this type of education in Japan can be beneficial in many ways. First, it
        enables students to understand their cultural roots and their deep connection to
        Chinese culture. Second, it allows students to develop their language skills in a way
        that broadens their perspectives. Finally, it encourages students to engage in
        critical thinking and interpretation, as the translation of classical texts is a
        complex and nuanced process. Japan must therefore continue to value and promote this
        traditional approach to education.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, Japan's unique approach to compulsory Kanbun education, particularly
        the teaching of classical Chinese, has had a far-reaching influence on the Japanese
        language and literature and on the country's cultural heritage. Comparisons with
        South Korea and Europe underline the distinctive national influences on the practice
        of classical language teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there are criticisms, particularly about the practicality of Kanbun, it is
        important to recognize its value in promoting reading comprehension and cultural
        understanding. It is also important to maintain a balance between preserving heritage
        and preparing students for a globalized world. The complexity of this issue invites
        further research and discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the challenges, Kanbun education, with its multi-dimensional benefits,
        provides a valuable case study for incorporating historical culture into modern
        education. It is therefore worth continuing to promote this tradition, adapting it
        as necessary to contemporary needs. The study of Kanbun offers an insightful
        perspective on the intersection of past and present in educational practice.
